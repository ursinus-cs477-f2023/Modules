  instructions: "<p>Fill in the <code>myfftconvolve</code> method to implement a DFT-based convolution similar to what we just talked about, but where the length of the zeropadded array is rounded up to the nearest power of two above M+N-1, so that the Fast-Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm can run.  Since you've rounded the length up, at the end, you'll need to cut down and return the slice 0:M+N-1.</p>"
  packages: "numpy"
  goals:
    - To leverage the convolution/multiplication property to implement convolution efficiently with an FFT
    - To use slices in numpy arrays
