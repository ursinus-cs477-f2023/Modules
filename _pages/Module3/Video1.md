<h2>Standing waves</h2>

<p>
Let's take a moment to think about the physics behind vibrating strings, which will motivate some of the design choices we make when trying to synthesize sounds that are more interesting than pure tones.  What we find is that the string supports a so-called <b>base frequency</b> <code>f<SUB>0</SUB></code>, and all of the integer multiples of that frequency.  Fractional multiples of that frequency do not resonate, and they die out quickly, as explained in the video below

<h2>A Standing Wave Experiment</h2>
<p>
Now that we have a rough idea about the math, let's look at an experiment that shows how a string supports a base frequency and its integer multiples

<h2>Plucked string</h2>

<p>
So in the above video we see that a string held down at two ends supports "wavelengths" (physical length of repetition of the pattern on the string) that are integer divisions of the length between the two ends.  The longest wavelength corresponds to the base frequency and shorter wavelengths corresponding to the integer multiples of that frequency.  But what actually happens when a string is plucked?  Well, as it turns out, many of these wavelengths are present, and they all go at once.  What we find over time, though, is that the higher frequency ones die out more quickly.  Have a look at this slow motion video of a plucked string to see this
