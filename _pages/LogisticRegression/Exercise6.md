<p>
This is the last exercise for the module!  The purpose of this exercise is to get a software package called pytorch setup on your computer that we're going to use for neural nets.  Download the notebook <code>2DSeparate.ipynb</code> at <a href = "https://github.com/ursinus-cs477-f2023/TorchTest/archive/refs/heads/main.zip">this link</a>.  Then, run all of the cells, and type what you see at the bottom as a response to the canvas prompt at <a href = "https://ursinus.instructure.com/courses/16260/assignments/188712">this link</a>
