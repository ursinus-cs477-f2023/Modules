  instructions: "<p>The purpose of this exercise is to get you coding with high dimensional vectors in numpy.  Fill in the code below to return a 0 if a particular vector <b>v</b> is closer to the vector <b>a</b> or a 1 if it is closer to vector <b>b</b>.  The distance between two vectors can be computed as the magnitude of the vector subtraction between the two.</p>"
  packages: "numpy"
  goals:
    - Implement vector operations on high dimensional vectors in numpy
