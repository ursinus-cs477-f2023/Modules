  instructions: "<p>A group of Ursinus students wants to take a trip to The Poconos. The school wants students to use as many full buses as they can to hold the students, and anyone who's leftover should take a van.  As an example, suppose 87 students want to go on a field trip, a bus holds 10 people, and a van holds 4 people (yes, I know, these are small buses and vans). Then the most buses we can fill is 8 buses, but there are still 7 people leftover. We need 2 vans to hold those 7 people.</p><p>Modify the code below to compute the correct number of buses and vans.  The code has imported the <code>math</code> library, and you can use <code>math.ceil(number)</code> to round a number up and <code>math.floor(number)</code> to round a number down.  My solution had 3 lines and used the operators %, -, and /, as well as <code>math.ceil</code>.  You could have a few more lines to split stuff up if you wanted.  You could also have fewer lines!  But you should only need arithmetic operations; no loops, if statements, or anything like that (we will talk about those momentarily)</p>"
  goals:
    - To manipulate variables and types in python
    - To apply arithmetic expressions in python
